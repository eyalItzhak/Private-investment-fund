# Private-investment-fund (WIP)
## Summary

Creating a supportive environment for making investments on the Ethereum network. In this project, a contract was built in Solidity that includes the conditions for joining an investment portfolio, the definition of the "stakeholders" (those who approve the requests) and a manager.


A server was built using "express", and the rest api (axios) was used in order to simulate real-time communication with the stock market data. A database (mySQL) was used to keep the list of stock portfolios and keep records of active purchases.


The visual part is implemented using React.

##Demo
###note:
1.This is an unfinished version, so visually there will be an improvement, but functionally the code works.

2.In the demo there are several places that appear to be "missing information". In the current version this has been updated and is no longer relevant.
