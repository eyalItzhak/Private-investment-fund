# Private-investment-fund
## Summary

Creating a supportive environment for making investments on the Ethereum network. In this project, a contract was built in Solidity that includes the conditions for joining an investment portfolio, the definition of the "stakeholders" (those who approve the requests) and a manager.


A server was built using "express", and the rest api (axios) was used in order to simulate real-time communication with the stock market data. A database (mySQL) was used to keep the list of stock portfolios and keep records of active purchases.
The visual part is implemented using React.
